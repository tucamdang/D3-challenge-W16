In this task, we are assumed as a data visualisation position for a major metro paper. Analysing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.
Data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc.

Task:
create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as ``Healthcare vs. Poverty`` or ``Smokers vs. Age``.
create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements by editing code in ``app.js``

BONUS:
Place additional labels in scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display.
Create three for each axis: 
      - xAxis: Poverty | Age | Household
      - yAxis: Obese | Smokes | Lacks Healthcare
